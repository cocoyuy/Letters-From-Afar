“Letters From Afar” is a VR interactive storytelling piece that consists of four letters I wrote to my mom when studying away in Abu Dhabi. It uses visuals to convey my emotions during that period of time, and enables interactions with VR controllers to enrich audience engagement and in-experience immersiveness.

The project is better experienced on headsets with controllers. On laptops, you can use space bars and up arrow keys to interact, however, the interactions are limited.
